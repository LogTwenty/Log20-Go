# Log20 - Go

## Quickstart

### Java Implementation

Log20-java comprises an instrumentation library, a tracing library used for both request tracing and logging, and an LPS placement generator using the algorithm we just examined. The instrumentation library uses Soot for bytecode instrumentation.

The tracing library has low overhead and consists of a scheduler and multiple logging containers (one per thread), each with a 4MB memory buffer. Log entries are of the form timestamp MethodID#BBID, threadID plus any variable values. In the evaluation, each logging invocation takes 43ns on average, compared to 1.5 microseconds for Log4j.

If youâ€™re feeling brave, you can even have Log20 dynamically adjust the placement of log statements at runtime based on continued sampling of traces.
